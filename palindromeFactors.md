You are given a positive integer A. Find the number of factors of A which are palindromes. A number is called a palindrome if it remains the same when the digits in decimal representation are reversed. For instance, 121 is a palindrome, while 123 is not.

## Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow.

Each line represents a test case and contains a single integer A.

## Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of factors of A which are palindromes.

## Limits
Time limit: 2 seconds.
Memory limit: 1 GB.
1≤T≤100.
